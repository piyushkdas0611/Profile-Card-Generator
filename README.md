# Fork, Clone, Make Changes, and Create a Pull Request
This guide will walk you through the process of contributing to this repository by forking it, cloning your fork, making changes, checking out a new branch, committing those changes, pushing them to your fork, and finally, creating a pull request to suggest your changes to the original repository.

## Fork the Repository
Click the "Fork" button at the top right corner of this repository's page. This action will create a copy of the repository under your GitHub account.
## Clone Your Fork
Open your terminal (command prompt or Git Bash on Windows, or a terminal on macOS and Linux).

Navigate to the directory where you want to store the project (use cd to change directories).

Clone your fork of the repository by replacing <your-username> with your GitHub username:

```
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/repository-name.git
```

Change to the newly created directory:

```
cd repository-name
```

## Make Changes
Create a new branch for your changes, giving it a meaningful name related to the issue or feature you're working on:

```
git checkout -b feature-or-fix-name
```

Make your desired changes to the project using your preferred code editor or IDE.

## Commit Your Changes
Add the changes you made to the staging area:

```
git add .
```

Replace . with specific file names if you only want to stage certain files.

Commit your changes with a descriptive commit message:

```
git commit -m "Add a brief description of your changes"
```

## Push Your Changes
Push your changes to your fork on GitHub:

```
git push origin feature-or-fix-name
```

## Create a Pull Request
Visit the original repository on GitHub.

You will see a green "Compare & pull request" button. Click it.

Add details about your pull request, including what changes you made and any context necessary.

Review your pull request and, if everything looks good, click "Create pull request."

Congratulations! You've just created a pull request with your changes. The project maintainer will review your request, and if accepted, your changes will be merged into the main repository. Thank you for contributing!

If you have any questions or encounter issues during this process, feel free to open an issue or reach out to the maintainers for assistance.
